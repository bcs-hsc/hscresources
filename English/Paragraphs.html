<a href="../">Go Back</a>
<p>There are many ways to structure your english essay paragraphs. Your teacher, class or school may have a specific method they want you to follow, or you might have your own structure you find works well. If you don't, or you want to explore some different ones, this page will outline the main ones. </p>

<h2>üîî PEAL</h2>
<p>Sometimes also known as PEEL, TEAL or TEEL.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Point</b>: or Topic. This is your topic sentence for the paragraph. Should tie in with your thesis and the themes of the text.</li>
  <li><b>Evidence</b>: This is where you link in evidence from the text. Can be quotes, descriptions of cinematic techniques, etc. You should also mention any literary, rhetoric, visual or cinematic techniques here.</li>
  <li><b>Analysis</b>: or Explain This is where you explain the impacts the evidence has on the development of a macro technique, the audience, or what it does. What exactly you write here will vary with what your essay is on.</li>
  <li><b>Link</b>: Link back to your thesis and/or adress the question.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üå∏ PETAL</h2>
<p>This structure places a stronger emphasis on the techniques and analysis in comparison to PEAL.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Point</b>: This is your topic sentence for the paragraph. Should tie in with your thesis and the themes of the text.</li>
  <li><b>Evidence</b>: This is where you link in evidence from the text. Can be quotes, descriptions of cinematic techniques, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Technique</b>: This step can be kept as its own sentence, or can be merged into the Evidence sentence. Outline what techniques are used, but avoid listing them.</li>
  <li><b>Analysis</b>: This is where you explain the impacts the evidence has on the development of a macro technique, the audience, or what it does. What exactly you write here will vary with what your essay is on.</li>
  <li><b>Link</b>: Link back to your thesis and/or adress the question.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PETAL structure can be repeated within the same paragraph to form a more complex layered paragraphs, and can be used in different orders, as long as Point comes first and Link comes last. Eg, PETAETAL or PETATATAL</p>

<h2>üî© STEEL</h2>
<p>Much like PETAL, this structure places a stronger emphasis on the techniques and analysis in comparison to PEAL, but focuses more heavily on the flow of analysis by placing Technique before evidence.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Statement</b>: This is your topic sentence for the paragraph. Should tie in with your thesis and the themes of the text.</li>
  <li><b>Technique</b>: This step can be kept as its own sentence, or can be merged into the Evidence sentence. Outline what techniques are used, but avoid listing them.</li>
  <li><b>Evidence</b>: This is where you link in evidence from the text. Can be quotes, descriptions of cinematic techniques, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Effect</b>: or Analysis. This is where you explain the impacts the evidence has on the development of a macro technique, the audience, or what it does. What exactly you write here will vary with what your essay is on.</li>
  <li><b>Link</b>: Link back to your thesis and/or adress the question.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PETAL structure can be repeated within the same paragraph to form a more complex layered paragraphs, and can be used in different orders, as long as Point comes first and Link comes last. Eg, PETAETAL or PETATATAL</p>
